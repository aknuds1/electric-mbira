# How to build an electric mbira from titanium bicycle spokes and radio controlled boat parts
It started with an [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFlQoIkLvGrncUoQS8-B4Xms0ySK1vCWJMhbHw0/?taken-by=mengqimusic) from Meng Qi, a fantastic musical instrument designer from Beijing.

It showed a handful of brightly-coloured titanium rods; “Titanium [kalimba](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/kalimba/) blades with single piece bridges. From Yasushi of Mbiraski, true high end.”

That was how I discovered [Mbiraski](http://www.mbiraski.com/), which sells beautiful one-off thumb pianos , made in Japan, with built-in preamps and headphone amplifiers for £350-£400.
