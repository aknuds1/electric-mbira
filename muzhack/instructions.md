# Parts
## The Tines
* The tines are Titanium bicycle spokes, 14g grade, which are 2mm in diameter.
* The rainbow-anodised spokes that Mbiraski uses can cost £90+ for a pack of 40, but I found an [eBay store selling](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/DT-SWISS-Ti-MMC-252mm-14G-TITANIUM-SPOKE-/121890033038?hash=item1c61364d8e:g:-TUAAOSwezVWuh7q) individual similar ones in raw (grey) titanium for £1.59 each and bought six. The matte texture of the titanium is nice.
* Detailed googling about [Young’s Modulus and Density](http://faculty.smu.edu/ttunks/projects/merrill/Mar_4.html) has left me pretty sure that steel spokes will work just as well — they’re a lot cheaper. I don’t think spokes with a plastic coating ([like these ones](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/total-bmx-double-butted-spokes-rainbow/rp-prod138348?gs=1&gclid=CjwKEAjwm8-6BRDgnb-Dk96UmRASJADbMycY9XNSTb7DPxZ1BtqxDLbQL2oCNm0h8Xw6WM5Ovz5JDhoC4xfw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)) would be very good.

## The Mounts
* I spent a lot of time trying to work out how to fix the spokes.
* The ‘saddles’ in Meng Qi’s picture look very elegant, and I have no idea what they are.
* These [linkage stoppers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B019STE9L4/) are used in remote controlled planes and boats to connect push rods. They’re tiny, designed for 2mm rods. £2.87 for 20.
* They come in lots of different designs. I wanted some that looked sturdy, and where the bolts were threaded all the way, so they’d do up tight.

## The Rest
* I used a Hammond 1590B cast aluminium box, £7 from [Bitsbox](http://www.bitsbox.co.uk/), but you can work with any size/shape.
* To amplify it, I attached two Piezo disks, ([similar to these from Maplin](http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/3v-ceramic-piezo-transducer-2718-yu87u)) to the bottom with quick drying epoxy glue, wired up to two 3.5mm sockets.

# Building it
Once you have all the parts, construction is really simple and fast. Map out where you want your ‘bridges’ (it’s worth thinking about this more than I did), drill 2mm holes. Drill holes for the sockets, then bolt everything loosely into place.

## Cutting the tines — theory
To work out how long to make the tines, you need to use a version of the [Twelfth root of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_root_of_two), the formula calculated in 1636 by the French mathematician Marin Mersenne, which is the basis of Equal Temperament.

I cut the first tine at random — it was the top straight tine with the curled up end — attached it and plucked it. It was roughly A, so I tuned it to exactly A (by moving it back and forward on the bridge using the grub screw).

Then I knew what length titanium bicycle spoke makes an A. It was 7.2cm (plus the 1cm on the other side of the bridge).

Using [Exmis Free Bar Length Calculator](http://windworld.com/features/tools-resources/exmis-free-bar-length-calculator/), I was able to enter 7.2 and calculate a whole range of lengths up and down the scale. For the five straight tines I chose a minor pentatonic scale — A, C, D, E, G.

Here’s [another version of the calculator as a Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kNvNHfqSURGooS-ai6XXqUu-obmRdH9696iBcRhrNjU/edit?usp=sharing), which I found easier to work with.

The longer, tines are folded to take up less space, but as you can see, this is a skill that needs a bit of practice.

## Cutting the tines — practice

The spokes have a screw thread on one end, which is slightly larger than the rest of the rod, so needs to be removed before they’ll fit into the stoppers.

I cut the tines with a Dremel, which worked fine and was pleasingly spectacular. Remember to smooth off the ends, because you’ll be playing them.

## Wiring and electrics
I used two piezo disks. They’re more ‘directional’ than I expected, so it works well. I use [Mikrophonie](http://musicthing.co.uk/modular/?page_id=973) modules to amplify the disks through my modular (if you find the Mikrophonie module distorts — the mbira can put out big bassy sine waves — consider changing R10 from 56k to 10k to reduce gain). Google [‘piezo preamp’](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=piezo+pre+amp&gws_rd=ssl) and you’ll find lots of projects.

Mbiraski uses piezo strips rather than disks, which should give a much more even response.

## Anodizing the tines
Once the box is assembled, carefully hold the tines over a gas ring, and they will turn amazing blue/black colours.

# Improvements for next time
* Plan the ergonomics — how will it fit into your hand and how will you play it? Mine doesn’t do either very well.
* Plan the notes; work out a sensible range. Nearby or harmonically related notes will resonate with each other.
* Buy more bits than you need — you might want to build a second one as soon as you’ve finished the first.
